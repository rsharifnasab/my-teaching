# Why Linux? (Philosophy)
+ Free software vs Proprietary software?
+ Why GNU/Linux?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy

-------------------

# Free software's 4 Freedoms

+ The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
+ The freedom to study how the program works, and change it, so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
+ The freedom to redistribute copies, so you can help others.
+ The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
