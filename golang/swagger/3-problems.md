Problems with the API Design:

    Incorrect HTTP Methods:
        /create-user uses a GET method to create a new user, which is inappropriate. GET should be used for fetching data, not for creating resources. The correct method here should be POST.
        /update-user/{userId} uses a POST method for updating the user. Typically, PUT or PATCH is more appropriate for updates, as these are designed to modify existing resources.
        /deleteUser/{userId} uses a GET method to delete a user, which violates REST principles. Deleting a resource should use the DELETE method.

    Inconsistent and Poor URL Design:
        /create-user and /deleteUser/{userId} have inconsistent URL naming conventions. The former uses a hyphen (-), while the latter uses camelCase (deleteUser).
        /create-user should be more RESTful. A better design could be /users with a POST request, which clearly indicates that the API is creating a new user.
        /update-user/{userId} could be simplified to /users/{userId}, keeping the resource-oriented design consistent.

    Incorrect Use of Headers:
        In all three endpoints, the X-Auth-Token header is required, but it is not clearly documented why this token is necessary or how it is used. It would be better to include authentication as part of a broader security scheme (e.g., using OAuth2 or API keys with proper documentation).
        Headers should ideally be part of a security definition (e.g., Bearer token or API Key) rather than a manually defined parameter in each endpoint. This would reduce redundancy and make the API definition cleaner.
