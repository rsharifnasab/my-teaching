# objects in OOP

+ objects are the most important part of Object oriented programming!
+ we define `classes` and then, create `instance` (or `objects`) from them 
+ instancing in Java is done with `new` keyword
+ we define classes based on problem space.
+ designing good classes need experience
+ every object could have `fields`,  `methods`,  `constructors` and etc

+ before creating instance, we can't use the declared reference. (see memory model page)
