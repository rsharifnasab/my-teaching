# what's new in newer versions of Java

in normal courses, we mostly learn OOP in Java, all thing up to Java-7

but in 2014, oracle released Java 8, biggest Java update ever, even more than Java 5 (released generics in jdk5)

Java has some LTS (stands for Long Term Support) versions, they are supported more, Java 8 and Java 11 are latest LTS versions but actually Java 8 reached nearly end of life.

## why Java 8 is important?

why we don't introduce Java 9? or Java 11? it is LTS too!

after Java 8, Java changed from a pure OO language to multi-paradigm language.
