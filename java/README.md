# learning OOP with Java

here we want to learn concepts of Object Oriented Programming with Java together



there are many programming paradigms..

## programming paradigms 

1.  Procedural Programming
      + codes are in procedures (routines or functions)
      + data are in variables (int, char, ..)
      + execution of program is calling procedures and modifying variables
      + we learn in **ITP** course!

   

2. Object Oriented Programming

   + codes are in methods

   + data are in fields

   + execution of program is [message passing](https://programmingwords.com/home/message-passing) between Objects

   + we learn in **AP** course

     

3. Functional Programming

   + functions as first class citizens

   + higher order functions 

   + immutable data
   
     


4. Aspect Oriented Programming
    + not separate from FP or OOP
     + add some aspect to code without writing more code
     + describing corners instead of writing code 



# Introduce to OOP

### States

+ fields (contain data)
+ what information we have about this object

### Behavior

+ methods (functions)
+ methods contain codes
+ what can this object do

### Identity 

+ why object is different from the other
+ `equals` method

# OOP principles

+ Abstraction 
+ Encapsulation
+ Inheritance
+ Polymorphism
